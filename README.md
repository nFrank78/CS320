How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

In order to ensure that my code is functional I make sure to study the requirements carefully and ensure that every criteria is met to the best of my coding abilities and then thoroughly tested and confirmed to be in working order. The same goes for security although this can be a bit more daunting of a task. In order to ensure security I must keep up with the best and safest coding practices as well as make sure to thoroughly test my code and cover any and all dependencies. By ensuring that my tests have the highest possible code coverage will also help to ensure that my code is functioning properly and is secure.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpretting user needs can be a complex task but through thorouhg analysis and by breaking them down into requirements I can incorporate them into the program. Simpler user needs such as input constraints and basic functionality can be simple to identify and incorporate but in more complex user requests and subsequently complex systems, these can be much more difficult to interpret and impliment but through good communication and by breaking needs down into listed requirements, I can incorporate them into a program.

How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by first thoroughly analyzing the user needs and requirements and then breaking them down. The base functionality of the system should be it's foundation where I begin and then add any other necessary side functionality after I have creating the base product and ensured it's functionality. Although I do not have much experience designing software for any clients except for class projects and myself, I beleive that good lines of communication with the client is an important part in understanding the requirements and in turn developing a good system that works as intended and meets all of the user's needs.
